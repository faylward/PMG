# PMG

This repo contains code used for the identification of phylogenetic marker genes (PMGs) in metagenomic datasets. This code is under active development and will eventually contain methods for the prediction of a variety of PMGs, but at the moment it is focused on benchmarking for the rpoB gene, or the RNA polymerase beta subunit.
